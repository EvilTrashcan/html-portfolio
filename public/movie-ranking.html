<h1> The best movies of all time according to me!</h1>
<h2> Top 3 movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3> Interstellar</h3>
<p> The absolute best sci-fi movie to date, a sneak peak to what us, mortals, could fathom of the universe that we know so little about.</p>

<h3> Her</h3>
<p> It's a movie about a man who falls in love with an AI app that he percieves to be a woman.</p>

<h3> The hunger games: catching fire</h3>
<p> Lots of action and emotion.</p>
